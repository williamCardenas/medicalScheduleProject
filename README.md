# medicalScheduleProject
This project is a implementation of my final paper on computer science course, i'it's a web system for scheduling appointments at a local clinic, aiming at the minimum number of records in the database about each appointment to avoid recording ROT data. This system will serve as a background for a practical analysis project to validate a purely TDD development environment oriented to the PHP stack.

The complete paper with how I applyed Tdd process is published on https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5361434/Test-Driven-Development-with-PHP-PHPUnit-and-Symfo
